									<h2>About us</h2>
								</header>

								<p>COVID19 COLLABORATIVE is a venture to collaborate with individuals, researchers, and NGOs in India and create an open-source platform that facilitates crowd-sharing and crowd-caring.
									We are a group of researchers and professionals from across the globe who wish to be a tiny cog in the wheel to help in India's collective fight against the coronavirus pandemic. <br>Ours is a pro bono, collaborative and crowd-sharing platform enabling people to find local/online deliveries of essentials across India, NGOs working at the grassroots level, and research articles/news links from trusted sources. We will refrain from commenting or giving our inferences/judgements on any research articles or news links, and will provide the sources of every research article and news link. We do not however, take responsibility for the views expressed in these research papers or news items. Our purpose is not to promote any NGOs or delivery stores through our website,and it is upto the discretion of the users to reach out to specific stores or NGOs for providing support. Our task is to create a vast repository across the country, and not to be party to the transactions between users of our website. <br>Contact us: <u>covidcollab19@gmail.com</u></p>


								<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>	
								<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12 col-12-small">

											<ol>
												<li><b>Who are you?</b>
												We are Indian research, technology and financial professionals who are passionate about reaching-out and collaborating to help those in need and spread awareness.
												</li>
												<li><b>Why are you doing this?</b> We want to create a one-stop, open-source portal to: 
												<ul>
													<li> facilitate common people to gain access to basic needs while staying at home by exploring neighborhood stores/resources across India.</li>
													<li> connect the people in need, and those looking to volunteer for help, with philanthropist organizations or NGOs working at the grassroots level. </li>
													<li> create a repertoire of research articles and tweets to create awareness by spreading scientific facts, not fiction or fear.</li>
													<li> inspire the community with motivational news and websites of other initiatives fighting the Coronavirus globally. </li>
													<li> allow users to easily contribute and collaborate to each of these causes, and seamlessly create a strong network during these troubled times. </li>
												</ul>

												</li>
												<li><b>How do you profit from doing this?</b>
												We do not intend to profit from this. We are passionate about creating a helpful platform and believe that open-source collaboration will help us battle this pandemic together.
												</li>

												<li><b>How critical you are in terms of fact-checking and verification?</b> 
												We will refrain from giving our own inferences or judgements on any topic, and will only share links from trusted sources such as mainstream news, research journals and social media posts by experts.
												</li>

												<li><b>What is the list in Sharing and Caring about?</b> 
												As the lockdown has now been extended till 3 May 2020, we feel one of the challenges is to get access to essentials for which people need to step out of their homes. Through our Sharing and Caring page we hope to create a list of local and online grocery/medicine deliveries. The intent is to obviate the need for people to step out of their homes during the lockdown period.
												</li>

												<li><b>How are you validating the contacts in Sharing and Caring?</b> 
												We validate the contacts in Sharing and Caring through one of two ways. Either, we personally contact the vendor and confirm that the service is ongoing, or, we trust the information provided after verifying the source that provided us with the contact. Sometimes, these contacts may not be a hundred percent effective - and for that purpose we welcome feedback regarding them through email (covidcollab19@gmail.com).
												</li>

												<li><b>How relevant is the research section for common people?</b> 
												The pandemic is evolving on a daily basis and new information is being uncovered the whole world over. Our section on ongoing research and expert narratives is for anyone looking to stay up to date without having to plough through the scientific jargon. To achieve this, we have created a twitter page for the disease with tweets from verified experts - who explain in the common tongue - relevant information about COVID19.
												</li>

												<li><b>Why are you contacting NGOs?</b> 
												We believe that we can maximize our impact and help more people by working together with other organizations involved in similar efforts during this crisis. Our portal will enable NGOs to post updates on the good work they are doing. It will also facilitate them to broadcast any support they require in terms of volunteers and crowdfunding.
												</li>

												<li><b>Are you in contact with the NGOs listed in your website?</b> 
												Yes we are establishing communication with NGOs and seeking their consent to post their details on our website. However once our website scales up, we will also give the option to new NGOs to join our website through forms. In this case, we will be verifying the website/social media pages of the NGOs before posting their information on our portal.
												</li>

												<li><b>How can someone collaborate with you on any project if they want to?</b> 
												We have google form links and instructions to contribute on each of the tabs of the website. As soon as someone submits the form, within 24 hours we will verify the information provided and, if credible, upload the information onto the website for the world to see. People can also contact us through email at covidcollab19@gmail.com.
