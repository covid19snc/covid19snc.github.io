									<h2>About us</h2>
								</header>

								<p>COVID19 COLLABORATIVE is a venture to collaborate with individuals, researchers, and NGOs in India and create an open-source platform that facilitates crowd-sharing and crowd-caring.
									We are a group of researchers and professionals from across the globe who wish to be a tiny cog in the wheel to help in India's collective fight against the coronavirus pandemic. <br>Contact us: <u>covidcollab19@gmail.com</u></p>

								<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>	
								<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12 col-12-small">

											<ol>
												<li><b>Who are you?</b>
												We are Indians who are research, technology and financial professionals in top universities and organizations, and are passionate about reaching-out and collaborating to help those in need and spread awareness.
												</li>
												<li><b>Why are you doing this?</b> We want to create a one-stop, open-source portal to: 
												<ul>
													<li> facilitate common people to gain access to basic needs while staying at home by exploring neighborhood stores/resources across India through collaboration and contributions of volunteers.</li>
													<li> connect the people in need with philanthropist organizations or NGOs working at the grassroot level. </li>
													<li> create a repertoire of research articles and tweets for spreading scientific facts not fiction or fear.</li>
													<li> inspire the community with motivational news and websites related to fighting Coronavirus globally. </li>
													<li> allow users to easily contribute and collaborate to each of these causes, and seamlessly create a strong network during these troubled times. </li>
												</ul>

												</li>
												<li><b>How do you profit from doing this?</b>
												We have no intentions to make any sort of profit out of this. We are passionate about creating a helpful platform and believe that open-source collaboration is needed now more than ever, to battle this pandemic.
												</li>

												<li><b>How critical you are in terms of fact-checking and verification?</b> 
												We will refrain from giving our own inference or judgement on any topic, and will only share links that appear on trusted sources such as mainstream news, research journals and social media posts by experts.
												</li>

												<li><b>How are you validating the contacts in Sharing and Caring?</b> 
												We are validating the contacts in Sharing and Caring through one of two ways. Either, we personally contact the vendor and confirm that the service is ongoing, or, we verify the source that provided us with the contact and trust the information provided. Sometimes, these contacts may not be a hundred percent effective - and for that purpose we welcome feedback regarding them through email.
												</li>

												<li><b>How relevant is the research section for common people?</b> 
												Now is a time where lots of new research and information are being circulated on every platform. As research papers have a lot of scientific jargon that may be complex for the common people, we have created a twitter page for the disease with tweets from verified experts - who explain in the common tongue - relevant information about COVID19.
												</li>

												<li><b>How can someone collaborate with you on any project if they want to?</b> 
												We have google form links and instructions to contribute on each of the tabs of the website. As soon as someone submits the form, within 24 hours we will verify the information provided and, if credible, upload the information onto the website for the world to see. People can also contact us through email at covidcollab19@gmail.com.
												</li>
