Could it be swarming with Novel Coronavirus ? Chances are , it is . A scientific research published in New England Journal of Medicine suggests viable coronavirus can exist on cardboard, plastics and other surfaces for different amounts of time. <b>a.</b> <i>On plastic and stainless steel upto 72 hours.</i> <b>b.</b> <i>On cardboard upto 24 hours.</i> <b>c.</b> <i>On copper upto 4 hours.</i><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973" target="_blank"> <u>Read more</u></a></p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/preg1.png" height="150" alt="" /></span><b>Can Covid-19 affect pregnant women and the fetus?</b><br>Many covid-19 affected mothers gave birth to healthy babies in Wuhan, China and around the world. But the symptoms of the virus vary on pregnant women. However, the data on full implications on pregnant women is still very low. The best thing is always to exercise precaution especially if you are more than 28 weeks pregnant.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32232217" target="_blank"> <u>Read more</u></a></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/hyd1.png" height="100" alt="" /></span><b>Effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine with Azithromycin on Covid-19 patients.</b><br>The race to get Hydroxychloroquine has begun. But there is no proven scientific study to suggest the drug alone can completely cure Covid-19. The drug also has many side effects which are to be taken into account.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20300858?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"> <u>Read more</u></a></p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sero1.png" height="100" alt="" /></span><b>Serological assay to detect SARS-COV-2 antibodies in human blood.</b><br>Many Covid-19 infected people are asymptomatic and recover on their own. They never underwent any test. But antibody detection through blood tests can tell exactly how many people have been infected by Covid-19. It can help to determine the outreach of the virus in a given cluster. Also, it is a faster testing option than swab tests and can be used to determine the immuned workforce to deploy in hospitals without infecting non-Covid patients.<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1" target="_blank"> <u>Read more</u></a></p>
